# ReactGabApp
This is a generic react web app using:
- Parcel.
- Reusable components.
- BEM naming convention.
- Good modules structure.
- Libraries like *react-slick* and *Font Awesome*.

And some other tools like: prettier and eslint.

### NavigationBar component
The navigation bar is completly responsive, it uses the component *MobileNavigationBar* to change between pc and mobile, to close the mobile nav easier it uses the component *Backdrop* so you can touch anywhere on the screen outside the mobile navigation bar to close it.
