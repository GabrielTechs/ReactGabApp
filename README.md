# ReactGabApp
This is a generic react web app using:
- Parcel.
- Reusable components.
- Good modules structure.
- BEM naming convention.
- Libraries like *react-slick* and *Font Awesome*.

And some other tools like: prettier and eslint.

### NavigationBar
The navigation bar is completly responsive, it uses the component *MobileNavigationBar* to change between pc and mobile, to close the mobile nav easier it uses the component *Backdrop* so you can touch anywhere on the screen outside the mobile navigation bar to close it.

### IntroSlider
This is a carousel personalized using the library react-slick.

### Services and AboutusHighlight
This two components use the *HighlightCard* component.

The Difference is that the *Services* component use CSS Grid and *AboutusHighlight* uses flexbox to function they are both completly responsive and with different CSS styles.

### Footer
This is a simple responsive flexbox component to fill out with something you want and to put my name on it :D.
